            <p>Our Privacy Policy</p>

            <p>Your privacy is extremely important to us. If you have any questions or concerns about your privacy on memmee, email us at hello@memmee.com. From time to time, minor changes may be made to our Privacy Policy. Any changes will appear here.</p>

            <p>Who can see my memmees?</p>

            <p>All of your thoughts and uploaded photos are private unless you choose to share them with others or the public at large. Your private entries can only be accessed with your own username and password. If you choose to create a public link and share it via email or post to a social site, only that one entry will be public. All your other memmees created on our site will be private to your account.</p>

            <p>Your entries are not encrypted, but our policy is never to allow our site administrators to access the entries database unless to troubleshoot an issue.</p>

            <p>Is my personal information secure?</p>

            <p>Your memmee account is protected by your username (email address) and the password you create. It's critically important that you protect your username and password by logging out of your account when you are finished using memmee.</p>

            <p>We use industry standard practices to ensure that your sensitive data is secure. Passwords are not stored in our database as plain text. Instead it is one-way encrypted, so we cannot send your password to you. However, if you forget your password, you can reset it using our password reset facility.
            <p>We work with trusted third party services to provide our service to you. For storage of data, we use Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.
            <p>What information does memmee collect about me?
            <p>We only collect the information that we need so that you can use the service including, but not limited to, your email address, name, IP address, web browser, and mobile device

            <p>Does memmee share or sell my personal data?</p>
            <p>Absolutely not.</p>
            <p>We do work with trusted third party services, as described above, to provide our service to you. In addition, we work with contractors who work on our behalf sharing limited information to help better your experience.</p>
            <p>How do I deactivate my account?</p>
            <p>We are working to create an option for you to deactivate your account and for you to download a file of all your memmees. Until that it complete, you can email us at hello@memmee.com and we will manually deactivate your account.</p>

            <p>In addition to the above, memmee provides you with an opportunity to create and store thoughts, photos and other materials, and share some or all of that material ("User Content") with others if you wish.  However, in no event does memmee assume or have any responsibility or liability for any User Content or for any claims, damages or losses resulting from its inclusion on this site, or any use that may be made of the User Content by anyone.  You hereby represent to us that any User Content you provide will not infringe any proprietary or other rights of third parties or contain any libelous, tortious, or otherwise unlawful information.  While memmee assumes no obligation to monitor any User Content, memmee does reserve the right to modify or delete any User Content in any manner that memmee may determine is appropriate.</p>

            <p>How do I contact you with questions or concerns?</p>
            <p>Drop us a line at hello@memmee.com with any questions, thoughts or ideas. Our reason for existing is to make this an enjoyable, memorable experience for you, so let us know how we are doing.</p>
