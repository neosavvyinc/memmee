                <p class="bold">what is memmee?</p>

                <p>memmee is a new platform for busy people who want to remember, relive, and share small moments in life that are often overlooked and forgotten. (as ferris bueller once said, ”life moves pretty fast. if you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”)</p>
                <p>memmee offers a private space for you to capture fleeting thoughts, moods, and everyday interactions.</p>

                <p class="bold">can you give me an example?</p>

                <p>a memmee is the hysterical thing your kid said. a great lunch you had with an old friend. it can be a quick note about your mood. or a morning ritual. or the song that’s stuck in your head. we think of memmees as in-between moments -- between birthdays and holidays and other highly recorded and remembered events.</p>

                <p class="bold">why are in-between moments important?</p>

                <p>these moments make for the best memories. they help you reflect on the immediate past. and capture the essence of life.</p>

                <p class="bold">how do I use it?</p>

                <p>memmee makes it fun and simple to record, save, and share memories. we’ve built in useful (and sometimes ridiculous) writing prompts, photo uploading capability, style templates, and private storage space. for now you can share your memmees through links -- but soon you’ll be able to print cards and stickers, create memmee meetups, and more. once you build up an archive of memmees, you’ll really get a kick out of reliving them and sharing them.</p>

                <p class="bold">sounds good. anything else I should know?</p>

                <p>when you’re having a bad day, you can peruse your memmees for a good chuckle. your memmee archive is a good place to mine for anecdotes for that wedding toast or birthday roast. you’ll see that it’s a nice way to recall the past, to pause in the future, and to reflect all around.</p>

                <span class="title-blog">who we are</span>

                <p class="bold">aly racer, founder</p>

                <p>like you, i hold my share of titles -- mom, wife, sister, daughter, friend, aunt, multi-tasker, crazy busy professional. before memmee (was there ever really a before?), i spent 16 rock solid years working in digital media at amazing companies like the new york times, dailycandy, and penske media corp.</p>

                <p>i realized that whole weeks and months were going by in a flash of errands, office meetings, kids parties, tidying, and tucking-in. i had barely enough energy to watch a show at night, let alone relive and reflect on the day. i couldn’t remember all the little things that made me smile, laugh, or even scream.</p>

                <p>my peers confirmed it was the same for them. so i created memmee as my personal time machine.</p>
